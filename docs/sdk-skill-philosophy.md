# SDK Skill Philosophy

Guide for authoring SDK skill bundles — a new pattern that ships complete, opinionated Sentry setup wizards alongside each SDK.

## The Vision

SDK skills are **living documentation bundles**. Instead of a flat SKILL.md that covers one feature, an SDK skill covers everything a project needs: error monitoring, tracing, profiling, logging, session replay, and more. The agent acts as an expert who reads the project, makes opinionated recommendations, and guides the user through each feature — loading deep-dive references as needed.

## Bundle Architecture

```
skills/
  sentry-<platform>-sdk/
    SKILL.md                    # Main wizard
    references/
      error-monitoring.md       # Deep dive: errors, panics, wrapping
      tracing.md                # Deep dive: spans, distributed tracing
      profiling.md              # Deep dive: continuous profiling
      logging.md                # Deep dive: structured logs
      metrics.md                # Deep dive: counters, gauges, distributions
      crons.md                  # Deep dive: cron job monitoring
      session-replay.md         # Deep dive: replay (frontend only)
```

The main `SKILL.md` is the wizard — it stays lean. References are loaded conditionally based on what the user wants to configure.

**Loading a reference in SKILL.md:**
```markdown
Read ${SKILL_ROOT}/references/tracing.md for detailed tracing setup steps.
```

## Feature Pillars

Each SDK supports a subset of Sentry's pillars:

| Pillar | Backend SDKs | Frontend SDKs |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Error Monitoring | ✅ Always | ✅ Always |
| Tracing/Performance | ✅ Common | ✅ Common |
| Profiling | ✅ Some | ✅ Some |
| Logging | ✅ Common | ✅ Common |
| Metrics | ✅ Some | ✅ Some |
| Crons | ✅ Backend only | ❌ |
| Session Replay | ❌ | ✅ Frontend only |
| AI Monitoring | ✅ Some | ✅ Some |

Only include reference files for pillars the SDK actually supports. If a feature is experimental or beta, mark it clearly in the reference header.

## The Wizard Flow

The main SKILL.md implements a four-phase wizard:

### Phase 1: Detect

Scan the project to understand the stack:

```markdown
## Phase 1: Detect

Run these commands to understand the project:
- `cat go.mod` / `cat package.json` — identify language and framework
- `grep -r "sentry" go.mod package.json 2>/dev/null` — check if Sentry is already installed
- `ls frontend/ web/ client/ 2>/dev/null` — detect companion frontend/backend
```

### Phase 2: Recommend

Present opinionated feature recommendations based on what you found. Don't ask open-ended "what do you want?" — lead with a concrete proposal:

```markdown
## Phase 2: Recommend

Based on what I found, here's what I recommend setting up:

**Recommended (core coverage):**
- ✅ Error monitoring — captures panics, exceptions, and unhandled errors
- ✅ Tracing — your app has HTTP handlers; distributed tracing will show latency across services
- ✅ Logging — you're using zap; Sentry can capture structured logs automatically

**Optional (enhanced observability):**
- ⚡ Profiling — low-overhead CPU/memory profiling in production
- ⚡ Metrics — custom counters and gauges for business KPIs
- ⚡ Crons — detect silent failures in scheduled jobs

Shall I set up everything recommended, or customize the list?
```

Recommendation logic:
- **Error monitoring**: Always recommend — this is the baseline
- **Tracing**: Recommend when HTTP handlers, APIs, gRPC, or queues are detected
- **Profiling**: Recommend for production apps where perf matters
- **Logging**: Recommend when the app already uses a logging library
- **Metrics**: Recommend for apps tracking business events or SLOs
- **Crons**: Recommend when cron/scheduler patterns are detected
- **Session Replay**: Recommend for frontend apps, never for backend

### Phase 3: Guide

Walk through each agreed feature, loading the relevant reference:

```markdown
## Phase 3: Guide

For each feature in the agreed list:
1. Load the reference: `Read ${SKILL_ROOT}/references/<feature>.md`
2. Follow the reference steps exactly
3. Verify the feature works before moving to the next
```

Keep the main SKILL.md free of deep implementation details — that lives in the references.

### Phase 4: Cross-Link

After completing setup, check for coverage gaps:

```markdown
## Phase 4: Cross-Link

Check for a companion frontend or backend that's missing Sentry:
- `ls frontend/ web/ client/ 2>/dev/null` + check for package.json with a JS framework
- `ls backend/ server/ api/ 2>/dev/null` + check for go.mod or requirements.txt

If found, suggest:
> I see a React frontend in `frontend/` with no Sentry. Consider running the
> `sentry-react-sdk` or `sentry-svelte-sdk` skill for full-stack coverage.
```

## Reference File Guidelines

Each reference covers **one feature pillar** and is loaded on demand. Reference files can be longer than a typical skill — they are deep dives, not wizard flows.

**Required sections for each reference:**

```markdown
# <Feature> — <Platform> SDK

> Minimum SDK: `<package>@X.Y.Z+`

## Installation

## Configuration

## Code Examples

### Basic usage

### Framework-specific notes (if applicable)

## Best Practices

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
```

**Style rules:**
- Tables for config options, not prose lists
- One complete, working code example per use case — not multiple variations
- Note framework-specific differences (e.g., SvelteKit vs Svelte, Gin vs net/http)
- Include minimum SDK version at the top of every reference

## Error Monitoring: The Non-Negotiable Baseline

Error monitoring is not optional. Every SDK skill must:

1. Set up error monitoring in the initial `Init()` call — not as an opt-in
2. Use opinionated defaults that capture the most useful data:
   - `SendDefaultPii: true` (or platform equivalent) — includes user context
   - A sensible `TracesSampleRate` starting point (e.g., `1.0` for dev, lower for prod)
   - Automatic framework integrations (e.g., `http.Integration`, `gin.Integration`)
3. Make clear this is the baseline — everything else enhances it

```go
// Example opinionated baseline for Go
sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
    Dsn:              os.Getenv("SENTRY_DSN"),
    SendDefaultPii:   true,
    TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
    EnableTracing:    true,
})
```

Never present a minimal config that leaves users under-instrumented. The goal is full observability from day one.

## Staying Current

SDK skills ship alongside the SDK and must reflect the current API.

**In every SKILL.md and reference file:**
- State the minimum SDK version required for each feature
- Use current API names — never deprecated ones
- Mark experimental features with ⚠️ **Experimental** or 🔬 **Beta**
- Add this disclaimer in the Invoke section:

```markdown
> **Note:** SDK versions and APIs below reflect current Sentry docs.
> Always verify against [docs.sentry.io](https://docs.sentry.io) before implementing.
```

**When updating a skill:**
1. Check the SDK changelog for breaking changes since last update
2. Verify all code examples compile/run against the latest SDK version
3. Update minimum version requirements if new features raised the floor
4. Remove deprecated API usage

## Naming Conventions

| What | Convention | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Skill directory | `sentry-<platform>-sdk` | `sentry-go-sdk`, `sentry-svelte-sdk` |
| Main file | `SKILL.md` | — |
| Reference files | `<feature>.md` in `references/` | `references/tracing.md` |
| Skill `name` field | matches directory | `sentry-go-sdk` |
